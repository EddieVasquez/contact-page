<h1>About me</h1>

<p>My name is Eduardo Vasquez and I am 18 years old. I live in Brownsville Texas, which is in the most souther part of texas.
In my free time I like to read fantasy or sci-fi books. I also enjoy watching shows like Doctor Who
or Dragon Ball Super.
</p>

<h1>My Background</h1>
<p>I graduated from highschool two years ago and I attended The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley
for a year before i heard about this program and decided to do this instead.
</p>

<h1>Why Programing?</h1>
<p>I chose programing because I fell in love with it since I took a computer science class in highschool. 
I found that it was fairly simple for me to catch on but yet chalenging enough to kep me entertained. With
 this course I hope to develope my programing skills further and learn as many languages as possible.</P>
